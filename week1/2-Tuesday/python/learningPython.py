# ? TIP - If Python expects an indented body, you must provide one. If you need to, you can use the keyword pass as a placeholder for an indented body:

# greeting = "Hello %s, it is very nice to meet you and your friend %s!"

# name_of_user = input("What is your name? ")

# length_of_name = len(name_of_user)

# if length_of_name > 0:

#     name_of_friend = input("What is your friend's name? ")

#     print(greeting % (name_of_user, name_of_friend))

# else:

#     pass

# Example on Loops

# donuts_consumed = 0

# while (donuts_consumed < 4):

#     print("You have eaten %d donuts." % donuts_consumed)

#     donuts_consumed = donuts_consumed + 1
